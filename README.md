# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Used Car Data-
Project Description:
In the rapidly growing used car market, understanding the key factors that influence a vehicleâ€™s price, demand, and resale value is crucial for both buyers and sellers. To gain meaningful insights from available data, I developed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on a Used Car Dataset using Python.

This project focuses on performing a thorough, data-driven analysis of a used car dataset, identifying trends, patterns, and relationships between various attributes like car brand, model, year of manufacture, fuel type, transmission, ownership history, and price. The analysis aims to uncover how different factors impact car prices and availability in the pre-owned vehicle market.

# Features:
Detailed data cleaning and preprocessing for missing, duplicate, or inconsistent values.

Comprehensive visualizations to uncover hidden patterns and trends.

Analysis of price distributions across various features like brand, model, year, fuel type, and ownership status.

Correlation analysis to identify the most influential factors affecting car prices.

Insights presented in an easy-to-understand, interactive, and visually rich manner using popular Python libraries.
